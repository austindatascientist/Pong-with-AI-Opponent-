# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and Pygame, designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook. The game features an AI-controlled paddle on the left side of the screen and a player-controlled paddle on the right side.

## Controls

- **Up Arrow (`↑`)**: Move the player's paddle up.
- **Down Arrow (`↓`)**: Move the player's paddle down.

The AI paddle is on the left side of the screen, while the player's paddle is on the right side.

## Features

- The AI adjusts its difficulty based on the score difference between the player and the AI.

## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python installed along with the Pygame library. Since the code is designed to run in a Jupyter Notebook, you also need Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.

### 1. Install Pygame

In your Jupyter Notebook, run the following command in a cell to install Pygame:

!pip install pygame
